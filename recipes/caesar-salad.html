        <h6>Caesar salad with homemade dressing and croutons</h6>
        <p>You know how they have those ready to combine bags with the dressing, parmesan cheese, salad and croutons ready to go? Where you just mix them all together? Well, this only tastes slightly better than that and takes twice the time! But twice of 5 mins is 10 mins so still not bad!</p>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Croutons:
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 &deg;F. Cut baguette in half lengthwise then slice diagonally into 1/4" pieces. Place the breads onto a baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, combine 3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil (why they gotta call them out like that?) and 1 tsp of finely minced garlic. Drizezle garlic oil over croutons and sprinkle with 2 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese.</li>
                    <li>Toss until evenly coated. Spread in a single layer over the baking sheet and bake at 350 &deg;F until light golden and crisp (10-12 minutes), or to desired crispness</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Dressing:
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together garlic, dijon, Worcestershire, lemon juice and red wine vinegar.</li>
                    <li>Slowly drizzle in extra virgin olive oil while whisking constantly.</li>
                    <li>Whisk in 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp black pepper or however much you feel like.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>All together for the salad now:
                <ol>
                    <li>Rinse, dry and chop or tear romaine into bite-sized pieces. Place in a large serving bowl and sprinkle generously with shredded parmesan cheese and cooled croutons. Drizzle with caesar dressing and toss gently.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
